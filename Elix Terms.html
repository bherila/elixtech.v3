<h2>4. Bandwidth &amp; Utilization</h2>
<p>In addition to the other terms of this agreement, which apply to all plans, bandwidth and utilization, by its nature, is subject to a number of differing and/or additional terms.</p>
<p>4.1 The Company provides a generous amount of data transfer per account to our Customers so that they may create their Websites and have a significant amount of site visitors without having to worry about additional charges for traffic. While most Customers will not exceed their monthly data transfer limit we recognize that others may occasionally or consistently need more.</p>
<p>4.1.1. The Company reserves the right to review and limit bandwidth on any hosting account package or domain exceeding usage over and above the specified maximum package limits in accordance with the current price list published on the web site. Customers exceeding their monthly data transfer allotment as monitored by Company will be given the opportunity to pay for excess usage at a rate specified with hosting package purchased. If Customer does not purchase additional bandwidth resources in order to come into compliance then Company reserves the right to either throttle the site's bandwidth usage or suspend the site at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>4.1.2. Customer agrees to purchase additional monthly data transfer when their web site accounts exceed the monthly allotment during any month. A list of available data transfer packages available for purchase is maintained on Company web site.</p>
<p>4.1.3. Customer may not use Customer's Website to store Web pages, files or data for other IP addresses or domain names, nor may Customer use its Website as a repository for file data transfer such as auction image hosting. Customer may not use Customer's Website for &quot;Warez group&quot; download transfers. The Company reserves the right to make this determination, in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<p>4.1.4. The storage and distribution of music format files via the Company network is prohibited if the Customer does not own the full copyright of such files. Distribution of music files even if the Customer has the copyright must be done solely via the Customer's web site and not through third party external web sites linking direct to the files for download. Customer must prevent the direct linking to such files from external sites through anti-leaching scripts or other means available on the Internet.</p>
<p>4.1.5. The Company does not permit sites on the shared servers and virtual private servers (VPS) that use more than 20% of system resources, or sites which in the Company's view are detrimental to the enjoyment of the Company services by the Company's other clients, or are in the sole and final judgment of the Company, detrimental to network or business operations. If at any time the Customer&rsquo;s website generates enough data transfer to affect the performance of the other customer sites on the server, the Company reserves the full right to offer Customer the option of upgrading to a hosting plan that would be more suitable such as dedicated server plans or if serious enough to suspend or terminate the Customer&rsquo;s web site.</p>
<p>4.1.6. Customer may not consume more than the allowed resources described above for a period lasting longer than 1 hour (60 minutes). The Company may take whatever steps necessary to provide its services, and to provide for the enjoyment of such services by all of the Company clients, and to ensure that certain clients do not utilize services to the detriment of other clients. Customers with Websites that do not comply with these simple rules, or who seek to take advantage of the Company data transfer traffic plan in any detrimental way will at the discretion of the Company, have their sites canceled and/or removed from the servers and have service charges assessed. The Company will be the sole and final arbiter as to Websites or usages of resources that constitute violation or intent to violate our policies. Websites which the Company must suspend or cancel due to violation of these rules are not eligible to receive a refund for unused service, and are subject to charges for bandwidth and usage of resources as is posted on Company web site. Acceptance of these Terms of Services, and/or use of Company's services constitute an acceptance of any fines, penalties or service charges which might arise out of violation of these policies.</p>
<h2>5. Account Terms and Termination</h2>

An additional $25 account reactivation fee may also be charged if an account becomes suspended due to billing-related issues.

It is the customers&rsquo; responsibility to maintain a valid and working email address listed with the company billing department at all times while service is being provided. Renewal notices are sent via email to the contact email listed on customers account prior to the renewal date.

We may, however, monitor our service electronically to determine that our facilities are operating satisfactorily. Also, we may be required to disclose information transmitted through our facilities in order to comply with court orders, statutes, regulations or governmental requests. Finally, we may disclose information transmitted over our facilities where necessary to protect us and our customers from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary to the proper operation of the system. We are not responsible for loss of customer content or data. We do backup our database systems daily and customer hosting spaces weekly, but cannot guarantee the content is up-to-date or can be recovered in the event of system or hardware failure. It is always the customer's own responsibility to have a full backup of their data at all times. There are no backups performed on dedicated, virtual or email systems. We expect that our customers who provide web hosting services to others will comply fully with all applicable laws concerning the privacy of on-line communications. A customer's failure to comply with those laws will violate our policy. Finally, we wish to emphasize that in signing up for services and therefore agreeing to the Terms of Service, customers indemnify us for any violation of the customer of the Terms of Service, or of law or corporate policies, that results in loss to us or the bringing of any claim against us. This means that if we are sued because of activities of the customer that violate any law, the Terms of Service, the customer will pay any damages awarded against us, plus costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. We hope this Policy Statement is helpful in clarifying the obligations of Internet users, including us and our customers, as responsible members of the Internet.</p>
